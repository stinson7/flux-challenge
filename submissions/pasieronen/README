Both the dispatcher-to-store and store-to-view data flows use Bacon.js
(a functional reactive programming library, similar to RxJS), which
seems to work rather nicely here.

All the interesting code is in JediStore.js -- the dispatcher and
views are quite trivial. JediApp.js could probably be refactored a
bit, but this was the first time I used React, and it's very simple
code anyway.
